<h2>Logout RP Profile</h2>
<p>A set of Logout RP test is currently available in pilot phase. The tests
    can be grouped into:</p>
<dl>
    <dt><code>rp-init-logout</code></dt>
    <dd>Tests RP initiated logout as described in
        <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-session-1_0.html#RPLogout">RP-Initiated
            Logout</a>.
    </dd>
    <dt><code>rp-backchannel-rpinitlogout</code></dt>
    <dd>Tests RP initiated logout
        together with
        <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0.html#Backchannel">Back-Channel
            logout</a></dd>
    <dt><code>rp-frontchannel-rpinitlogout</code></dt>
    <dd>Tests RP initiated logout
        together with
        <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-frontchannel-1_0.html#RPLogout">Front-Channel
            logout</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>
    As can be understood from the list above supporting RP initiated logout is a
    prerequisite to do any of these tests.
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, support for provider information discovery and dynamic client
    registration is also needed.
</p>
<p>
    Running a test will consists of sending the following requests to the test
    suite (==OP)
<ol>
    <li>provider info discovery</li>
    <li>client registration</li>
    <li>authorization</li>
    <li>access token (depending on which response type is chosen)</li>
    <li>end session</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>Please test this test and submit your results to <a
        href="mailto:certification@oidf.org">certification@oidf.org</a> as
    described in <a href="http://openid.net/certification/rp_submission/">Submission
