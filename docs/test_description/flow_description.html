<h1 id="test_description">1. Test description syntax</h1>
<p>
    The test description files are JSON documents. Each of these documents
    contains a JSON object with a set of keys and values. The possible keys are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>assert</li>
    <li>desc</li>
    <li>group</li>
    <li>note</li>
    <li>reference</li>
    <li>sequence</li>
    <li>usage</li>
    <li>MTI</li>
</ul>
<p>These will be described one by one below.</p>
<h2 id="json_assert">1.1. assert</h2>
<p>Lists the assertions that are performed after a test has completed.</p>
<p>A example is:</p>
<pre>
    "assert": {
        "verify-response": {
              "response_cls": [
                    "OpenIDSchema"
              ]
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>The interpretation of this is that the assertion with the identifier</p>
<em>verify-response</em> will be executed with the argument
<pre>
    response_cls="OpenDISchema"
</pre>
<p>
    If a test run reaches the end of the
    <a href="#json_sequence">request sequence</a>
    the assertion checks are run one after the other.
</p>
<p>
    When some assertion checks fails that is registered as an Error, for some
    other
    checks a failure is logged as a Warning. And then there are a few where
    how a failure is interpreted is configurable.
</p>
<p>
    To get the result of the whole test run the results of the assertion checks
    are added together. Such that if there is one or more Error failures then
    the result of the test is an Error. If there is no Error failures but at
    least
    on Warning failure then the result is a Warning. If no failures are
    encountered that is logged as a Success.
</p>
<h2 id="json_desc">1.2. desc</h2>
<p>
    A human readable description of what the test is trying to accomplish.
</p>
<h2 id="json_group">1.3. group</h2>
<p>
    Which group the test belongs to. When the tests are presented to the tester
    tests belonging to the same group are listed together under the group
    header.
</p>
<p>Present list of used groups:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Response Type</li>
    <li>Response Mode</li>
    <li>Discovery</li>
    <li>Dynamic Client Registration</li>
    <li>ID Token</li>
    <li>Client Authentication</li>
    <li>Access Token</li>
    <li>Userinfo Endpoint</li>
    <li>claims Request Parameter</li>
    <li>display Request Parameter</li>
    <li>nonce Request Parameter</li>
    <li>prompt Request Parameter</li>
    <li>redirect_uri Request Parameter</li>
    <li>request Request Parameter</li>
    <li>request_uri Request Parameter</li>
    <li>scope Request Parameter</li>
    <li>Misc Request Parameters</li>
    <li>OAuth behaviors</li>
    <li>Key Rotation</li>
    <li>RP-Initiated Logout</li>
    <li>Back-Channel Logout</li>
    <li>Front-Channel Logout</li>
    <li>Session Management</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="json_note">1.4. note</h2>
<p>
    In some case the test tool needs to pass information to the tester.
    This is where that information is stored.
</p>
<h2 id="json_reference">1.5. reference</h2>
<p>
    Links to parts of the OpenID Connect and accompanying standards that are
    tested by the test.
</p>
<h2 id="json_sequence">1.6. sequence</h2>
<p>
    The complete flow of a test. This consists of a number of requests.
</p>
<p>
    Before a request is issued the arguments fo the request may be set to
    specific
    values. Also before a request is sent a check my be performed to figure out
    if
    there is any meaning to send the request. One reason for it not to be so
    would
    be that the OP does not support the functionality that is under test.
</p>
<p>
    An simple example of a sequence:
</p>
<pre>
  "sequence": [
    {
      "Webfinger": {
        "set_webfinger_resource": null
      }
    },
    {
      "Discovery": {
        "set_discovery_issuer": null
      }
    }
  ]
</pre>
<p>
    This sequence contains 2 requests, the first being a Webfinger request and
    the
    second a discovery request. Before the webfinger request is sent, the
    webfinger
    resource is specified by the <em>set_webfinger_resource</em> function.
    Similarly, before the discovery request is sent the issuer is collected
    using
    the <em>set_discovery_issuer</em> function.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Note:</b> If webfinger is not supported then that request is not
    sent.<br>
    The same goes for discovery. Which means that running this test when not
    supporting dynamic discovery is useless.
</p>
<p>
    A slightly more complex sequence:
</p>
<pre>
  "sequence": [
    {
      "Webfinger": {
        "set_webfinger_resource": null
      }
    },
    {
      "Discovery": {
        "set_discovery_issuer": null
      }
    },
    "Registration",
    {
      "AsyncAuthn": {
        "set_response_where": null
      }
    },
    {
      "AccessToken": {
        "conditional_execution": {
          "return_type": [
            "CIT",
            "CI",
            "C",
            "CT"
          ]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "UserInfo": {
        "set_op_args": {
          "method": "POST",
          "authn_method": "token_in_message_body"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
</pre>
<p>
    This starts in the same way as the previous one. Webfinger, provider info
    discovery and client registration is performed if supported.
</p><p>
    Then follows an Authorization, an Access token and finally an
    Userinfo request.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Note:</b>The Access token request will only be performed if the
    <em>response_type</em> is one of "code", "code token", "code id_token" or
    "code id_token token".
</p>
<p>
    <b>Note:</b> The Userinfo request will be formed as described in
    Section 2.2 of
    <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750#section-2.2">RFC6750</a>
</p>
<h2 id="json_usage">usage</h2>
<p>
    Specifies when the test can be used. This is connected to the test profiles.
</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  "usage": {
    "sig": true,
    "register": true,
    "extra": true
  }
</pre>
<p>
    This specific test will be included if the tester has specified that extra tests
should be used and the OpenID provider that is being tested supports dynamic
registration and signature creation/verification.
</p>
<p>The complete set of usage demands are:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>webfinger</dt>
    <dd>Tests if Webfinger is supported</dd>
    <dt>enc</dt>
    <dd>Tests if encryption and decryption is supported</dd>
    <dt>extra</dt>
    <dd>This test is an extra test.
        Not necessary to run for basic standard conformance testing
    </dd>
    <dt>discover</dt>
    <dd>Tests that dynamic discovery is supported</dd>
    <dt>sig</dt>
    <dd>Tests that signature creation and signature validation is supported</dd>
    <dt>none</dt>
    <dd>Tests support for signing_alg=None</dd>
    <dt>return_type</dt>
    <dd>The response_types that are expected to be used during testing</dd>
    <dt>register</dt>
    <dd>Tests is dynamic client registration is supported</dd>
    <dt>form_post</dt>
    <dd>Tests if the form_post response_type is supported</dd>
